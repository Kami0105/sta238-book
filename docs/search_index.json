Analyzing data is extraordinarily difficult, but is the only way to learn meaningfully about the world. In this book, you will learn about analyzing data. You will learn how to make principled, measured statements about the data on hand (descriptive statistics); how to use the data on hand to make statements about the underlying world, and how to quantify the uncertainty in your statements (inferential statistics), and how to use the data on hand to make judgements, with uncertainty quantification, about what data you will see next (predective statistics).

R code is given for the simple textbook datasets used in the book, and then the concepts are illustrated on real data. All datasets from the book can be downloaded here: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/applied-probability/education/mips/. 2.1 Old Faithful The Old Faithful data is stored in the oldfaithful.txt file in the book data folder. To read it in to R, first you need to look at its contents. 2.1.1 Read in the data You can either open it in a text editor (since it’s small), or print out the first few lines on the command line. If you plan on ever doing any meaningful work with data, the latter is really your only choice, so let’s do that. If you have a Mac or Linux-based system, open a terminal. If you have a Windows based system, get a Mac or Linux. Just kidding (not really though). Download Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/download/win and open a new terminal window. To look at a text file on the command line, use the head command. You have to tell it where to look on your computer. You can navigate to the folder where the data is stored and just type the name of the file, or you can type a whole filepath, or a relative filepath. Right now, I am in the working directory for this book, and relative to this location, the data is stored in data/MIPSdata. So I type: head data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt ## 216 ## 108 ## 200 ## 137 ## 272 ## 173 ## 282 ## 216 ## 117 ## 261 A column of numbers is printed. This indicates that the text file oldfaithdful.txt contains a single column of numbers, and no header row. A header row is what it’s called when the first row of the dataset contains the names of the columns. To read such a dataset into R, we’ll use the read_delim function in the readr package. The readr package is automatically loaded when we load the tidyverse package, so we’ll just do that: library(tidyverse) oldfaithful &lt;- readr::read_csv( file = &quot;data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt&quot;, # Tell it where the file is col_names = &quot;time&quot;, # Tell it that the first row is NOT column names, and at the same time, tell it what name you want for the column. col_types = &quot;n&quot; # Tell it that there is one column, and it is &quot;numeric&quot; (n) ) # Check what was read in using the dplyr::glimpse() function dplyr::glimpse(oldfaithful) ## Observations: 272 ## Variables: 1 ## $ time &lt;dbl&gt; 216, 108, 200, 137, 272, 173, 282, 216, 117, 261, 110, 235,… By glimpseing the data, we see that the format matches what we saw in the raw file, and we are given the number of rows too. Check that the number of rows matches what was in the raw file by printing out the number of rows on the command line using the wc -l command (“wc” = “word count” and “-l” means count “lines”): wc -l data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt ## 271 data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt What happened, why don’t they match? They do. The wc -l command actually counts the number of “newline” characters in the file. It is customary to end a data file with a newline character. This file doesn’t, though. How do I know? Type the following: tail data/MIPSdata/oldfaithful.txt ## 111 ## 255 ## 119 ## 135 ## 285 ## 247 ## 129 ## 265 ## 109 ## 268 This prints out the last few lines of the file. In this book, these are printed as normal. But if you do it on the command line, you’ll see that the command prompt gets printed on the same line as the final number, 268. This indicates that the file does not end with a newline character, and hence the total number of newlines in the file is 271, corresponding to 272 actual lines of data. Remark: I would wager that you are currently surprised that this was so difficult. Even reading in the simplest possible dataset created subtle challenges that needed to be addressed. There is probabably a reason this stuff isn’t taught as heavily in stats courses as it ought to be; it’s difficult and tedious and not as fun as math. But to do meaningful work using data, you have to get good at this stuff. So it is worth struggling through. 2.1.2 Analysis Now that the data has been read in and checked, we can realized the fruits of our labour! Chapter 15 analyzes these data using a tabular display, histogram, kernel density estimate, and empirical CDF. Here is how to do these things in R. # Tabular display print(oldfaithful$time) ## [1] 216 108 200 137 272 173 282 216 117 261 110 235 252 105 282 130 105 ## [18] 288 96 255 108 105 207 184 272 216 118 245 231 266 258 268 202 242 ## [35] 230 121 112 290 110 287 261 113 274 105 272 199 230 126 278 120 288 ## [52] 283 110 290 104 293 223 100 274 259 134 270 105 288 109 264 250 282 ## [69] 124 282 242 118 270 240 119 304 121 274 233 216 248 260 246 158 244 ## [86] 296 237 271 130 240 132 260 112 289 110 258 280 225 112 294 149 262 ## [103] 126 270 243 112 282 107 291 221 284 138 294 265 102 278 139 276 109 ## [120] 265 157 244 255 118 276 226 115 270 136 279 112 250 168 260 110 263 ## [137] 113 296 122 224 254 134 272 289 260 119 278 121 306 108 302 240 144 ## [154] 276 214 240 270 245 108 238 132 249 120 230 210 275 142 300 116 277 ## [171] 115 125 275 200 250 260 270 145 240 250 113 275 255 226 122 266 245 ## [188] 110 265 131 288 110 288 246 238 254 210 262 135 280 126 261 248 112 ## [205] 276 107 262 231 116 270 143 282 112 230 205 254 144 288 120 249 112 ## [222] 256 105 269 240 247 245 256 235 273 245 145 251 133 267 113 111 257 ## [239] 237 140 249 141 296 174 275 230 125 262 128 261 132 267 214 270 249 ## [256] 229 235 267 120 257 286 272 111 255 119 135 285 247 129 265 109 268 # Ugly!

Use ggplot2, which is loaded automatically with the tidyverse: oldfaithful %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time)) + theme_classic() + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),bins = 30,colour = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;blue&quot;,alpha = .3) + labs(title = &quot;Eruption times for Old Faithful geyser&quot;, x = &quot;Eruption time&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) # Try different numbers of bins and you might see different patterns. Do you think this is a # good or bad thing, or both? # Their &quot;optimal&quot; bin width: s &lt;- sd(oldfaithful$time) n &lt;- nrow(oldfaithful) b &lt;- (24*sqrt(pi))^(1/3) * s * (n^(-1/3)) b ## [1] 36.89694 oldfaithful %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time)) + theme_classic() + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),bins = round(b),colour = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;blue&quot;,alpha = .3) + labs(title = &quot;Eruption times for Old Faithful geyser&quot;, subtitle = stringr::str_c(&quot;&#39;Optimal&#39; bin width of b = &quot;,round(b)), x = &quot;Eruption time&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) To get kernel density estimates, there are a couple different ways. The density function in R does the math for you, using a Gaussian kernel (the functions \\(K_{i}\\) are taken to be Gaussian density functions with mean and standard deviation determined by the data). You can plot the output of density using base R or ggplot. You can also use the ggplot geom_density function to do something similar automatically. # Kernel density estimation in R dens &lt;- density(oldfaithful$time) dens ## ## Call: ## density.default(x = oldfaithful$time) ## ## Data: oldfaithful$time (272 obs.); Bandwidth &#39;bw&#39; = 20.09 ## ## x y ## Min. : 35.74 Min. :3.771e-06 ## 1st Qu.:118.37 1st Qu.:8.571e-04 ## Median :201.00 Median :2.412e-03 ## Mean :201.00 Mean :3.022e-03 ## 3rd Qu.:283.63 3rd Qu.:5.143e-03 ## Max. :366.26 Max. :8.070e-03 plot(dens) # Okay... ggplot? tibble(x = dens$x,y = dens$y) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x,y = y)) + theme_classic() + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;Kernel density estimate, Old Faithful data&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Manually-calculated values&quot;, x = &quot;Eruption time&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) # Can also do automatically: oldfaithful %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time)) + theme_classic() + geom_density() + labs(title = &quot;Kernel density estimate, Old Faithful data&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Automatically-calculated values&quot;, x = &quot;Eruption time&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) # The reason to manually calculate the values is because you have more control. # I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening at the endpoints there, and it&#39;s too much work # to go and figure out how to make ggplot not do that. # When you calculate the plotting values yourself and then put them into ggplot, # you have total control! For the empirical distribution function, we use the ecdf function in R. You would think this function should behave in a similar manner to the density function, but it doesn’t. It returns a function which computes the ecdf. It still has a plot method, but to use it with ggplot we have to use stat_function: faithful_ecdf &lt;- ecdf(oldfaithful$time) plot(faithful_ecdf) # ggplot tibble(x = c(100,300)) %&gt;% # Tell ggplot we want to plot the ecdf from 100 to 300 ggplot(aes(x = x)) + theme_classic() + stat_function(fun = faithful_ecdf) + labs(title = &quot;Empirical CDF for Old Faithful Eruption Times&quot;, x = &quot;Eruption Time&quot;, y = &quot;Empirical probability that an eruption time is less than x&quot;) Discussion point: the CDF is the integrated pdf: \\[ F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}{x}f(s)ds \\] So why don’t we integrate the kernel density estimate to get the empirical CDF? One of the great benefits of taking a computation-forward approach to statistical inference is that we can “shoot first and ask questions later”- just try it, and then (maybe) use math to explain the results. Here is the world’s most naive numerical integration-based estimate of a CDF: tibble( x = dens$x[-1], y = cumsum(dens$y[-1]) * diff(dens$x) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x,y = y)) + theme_classic() + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;Numerical integration-based empirical CDF for Old Faithful data&quot;, x = &quot;Eruption time&quot;, y = &quot;Empirical probability that an eruption time is less than x&quot;) What do you think? Is this better, worse, or just different than the ECDF? "],
["statistics-and-plots.html", "Chapter 3 Statistics and Plots 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Descriptive analysis 3.3 Exploratory analysis 3.4 Prescriptive analysis 3.5 Rental housing in Toronto", " Chapter 3 Statistics and Plots 3.1 Introduction How do we turn data into information? This question is highly contextual. The meaning of information will change depending on the task. And data isn’t a well-defined concept on its own. Even https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data defines data implicitly, as “a basis for…”. In this chapter we will discuss the use of data in the pursuit of three types of information: descriptive, exploratory, and prescriptive. 3.2 Descriptive analysis The most simple type of information available from a set of data is to describe what you have in front of you. The decisions you make about what to describe and how to describe it make a big difference. There is no one correct way to analyze any given dataset. You will make judgements, and assumptions, and you will have to justify and explain them. These judgements and assumptions can have a profound impact on the story you tell using your data. For example, consider a famous dataset containing information on smoking and mortality. The data is available in the R package faraway. We may load the package and data and retrieve information on it as follows: # install.packages(&quot;faraway&quot;) # Run this to install the faraway package, which has useful datasets library(faraway) # Attach the faraway package data(&quot;femsmoke&quot;) # Load the &quot;femsmoke&quot; data # ?femsmoke # Run this to open the help page for the dataset. Lines in R that begin with a pound sign (or “hashtag” for the younger, more hip reader), \\(\\#\\), are comments and are not run. Remove the \\(\\#\\) to run the code. We see from the help page, and associated reference to the paper in the American Statistician, that the data comes from asking women in Whickham, England, whether they smoke or not, and then following up in 20 years to see if they died. In describing the context surrouning the data—a quite natural step to take—we have achieved our first example of a descriptive analysis. We didn’t even use and numbers or code. Just describing what the data is counts. And it’s important, because as we learned in the introduction, information can’t exist without context. To go further in our descriptive analysis, we need some more quantitative pieces of descriptive information. What might we want to know about our data? Some ideas: How many observations are there in the data, and what does an observation represent in the context of how the data was collected? How many variables are present in the data, and what does each variable represent in the context of how the data was collected? How might we summarize each variable? We might compute a mean and a five-number summary for “continuous” variables, and a table of counts for “categorical” variables (more on this later…). Let’s see how we can obtain these descriptive measures in R: # install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) # install.packages(&quot;SMPracticals&quot;) # For datasets library(tidyverse) # We use a LOT of functions from this package. # Get the number of observations (rows), variables, and an idea # of what the data looks like: glimpse(femsmoke) ## Observations: 28 ## Variables: 4 ## $ y &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 1, 3, 5, 14, 7, 27, 12, 51, 40, 29, 101, 13, 64, 53, 6… ## $ smoker &lt;fct&gt; yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes… ## $ dead &lt;fct&gt; yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, ye… ## $ age &lt;fct&gt; 18-24, 18-24, 25-34, 25-34, 35-44, 35-44, 45-54, 45-54, 5… # One observation represents a count of people in each category. # How many people? femsmoke %&gt;% summarize(num_people = sum(y)) # The summarize() function lets you compute summaries of variables in your dataframe ## num_people ## 1 1314 # How many smokers? femsmoke %&gt;% filter(smoker == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% # filter() lets you choose which rows to keep summarize(num_smokers = sum(y)) ## num_smokers ## 1 582 # How many non-smokers? femsmoke %&gt;% filter(smoker == &quot;no&quot;) %&gt;% summarize(num_non_smokers = sum(y)) ## num_non_smokers ## 1 732 # We can get both those numbers at the same time: femsmoke %&gt;% group_by(smoker) %&gt;% # group_by() makes summarize() compute summaries within levels of a variable summarize(num_people = sum(y)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## smoker num_people ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 582 ## 2 no 732 There are lots of other descriptive statistics you could calculate. Summary: descriptive analysis involves communicating properties of a dataset, and the context behind the dataset. 3.2.1 Exercises How many non-smoking 18-24 year olds are there in the femsmoke data? Answer using filter(). How many smokers died? Answer using filter(). How many 45-55 year olds did not die? Compute the following table using group_by() and summarize(): ## # A tibble: 7 x 2 ## age num_people ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 18-24 117 ## 2 25-34 281 ## 3 35-44 230 ## 4 45-54 208 ## 5 55-64 236 ## 6 65-74 165 ## 7 75+ 77 3.3 Exploratory analysis Descriptive analyses are an important task any time you are working with data. However, they don’t accomplish anything new; they just, well, describe what you have. An exploratory analysis involves looking for patterns or structure in the available data. We can use what we find to make decisions or come to conclusions. One thing we can choose to explore about these data is whether we observe any apparent association between smoking and mortality. To investigate any such associations, we can look at the observed mortality rates for smokers and non-smokers. This is exploratory—not descriptive—because we are going beyond simply saying what the data looks like. We are looking for a pattern, namely, “do smokers die more or less frequently than non-smokers?” Exploratory analyses involve decisions made by us, the investigator. They are naturally subjective. Different decisions can lead to uncovering different patterns. For example: # Compute the mortality rate for smokers and non-smokers. # To do this, create a dataframe containing the numbers of smokers # and non-smokers smoker_numbers &lt;- femsmoke %&gt;% # The %&gt;% operator lets you form sequences of operations group_by(smoker) %&gt;% # group_by() makes all the following operations happen within groups summarize(num_people = sum(y)) # Count the number of people who are smokers and not smokers smoker_numbers ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## smoker num_people ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 582 ## 2 no 732 # Now, compute the number of people who died out of the smokers and non-smokers # This looks the same as above, except we now filter() only the people who died. smoker_numbers_dead &lt;- femsmoke %&gt;% filter(dead == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% # Retains rows where dead == &quot;yes&quot; only group_by(smoker) %&gt;% summarize(num_dead = sum(y)) smoker_numbers_dead ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## smoker num_dead ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 139 ## 2 no 230 # Now, we join these two tables together and compute the mortality rates by group. smoker_numbers %&gt;% inner_join(smoker_numbers_dead,by = &quot;smoker&quot;) %&gt;% # Joins rows with the same value of &quot;smoker&quot; mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) # mutate() creates a new variable, which can be a function of the other variables in the dataframe. ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## smoker num_people num_dead mort_rate ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 582 139 0.239 ## 2 no 732 230 0.314 See anything interesting? What went wrong? Why are we observing that smokers have a lower mortality rate than non-smokers? This contradicts the context surrounding this analysis, which in this case is the large body of formal and anecdotal evidence suggesting that smoking is harmful to health. Did we make a mistake? One thing we definitely did was ignore some present information. Specifically, we also know how old the women were. How can we include this information in our exploratory analysis? We can compute mortality rates by age: smoker_numbers_age &lt;- femsmoke %&gt;% group_by(smoker,age) %&gt;% # Now we&#39;re grouping by smoker AND age. The rest of the code remains unchanged. summarize(num_people = sum(y)) smoker_numbers_age_dead &lt;- femsmoke %&gt;% filter(dead == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(smoker,age) %&gt;% summarize(num_dead = sum(y)) smoker_numbers_age %&gt;% inner_join(smoker_numbers_age_dead,by = c(&quot;smoker&quot;,&quot;age&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) ## # A tibble: 14 x 5 ## # Groups: smoker [2] ## smoker age num_people num_dead mort_rate ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 18-24 55 2 0.0364 ## 2 yes 25-34 124 3 0.0242 ## 3 yes 35-44 109 14 0.128 ## 4 yes 45-54 130 27 0.208 ## 5 yes 55-64 115 51 0.443 ## 6 yes 65-74 36 29 0.806 ## 7 yes 75+ 13 13 1 ## 8 no 18-24 62 1 0.0161 ## 9 no 25-34 157 5 0.0318 ## 10 no 35-44 121 7 0.0579 ## 11 no 45-54 78 12 0.154 ## 12 no 55-64 121 40 0.331 ## 13 no 65-74 129 101 0.783 ## 14 no 75+ 64 64 1 Older people are more likely to die within the 20 year followup period. However, examining the raw counts of people in each group, we also see that in these data, older people are less likely to smoke than younger people. So in these data, less smokers died, because less smokers were old, and more old people died. But was our first analysis wrong? No. Our first analysis was fine: we computed the mortality rate in each group. The problem was in the reporting, or the way we told the story. We didn’t provide enough information when we said “the mortality rate for smokers was lower than for non-smokers”. We should have mentioned that this is averaging over all age groups. Even when we include age in the analysis, we ought to mention the fact that there are a whole lot of variables we could have measured but didn’t, and we are implicitly averaging over these too. Before moving on, get some practice doing exploratory analysis with the following exercises: 3.3.1 Exercises What is the relative risk of mortality—the ratio of the mortality rates—for smoking 18-24 year olds vs non-smoking 18-24 year olds? Compute the answer manually by reading the numbers off the above table. Then compute it using R by doing the following: Create two datasets using filter(): one containing smokers and one containing non-smokers. filter() out only the 18-24 year olds. This gives you two datasets each with only one row. For example, smokers &lt;- femsmoke %&gt;% filter(smoker == &quot;yes&quot;,age = &quot;18-24&quot;). inner_join() the two datasets together, using age as the by variable: smokers %&gt;% inner_join(???,by = &quot;age&quot;) Advanced: modify the above steps to create the following table of relative mortality rates. You should start from a cleaned up version of the mortality rate by age table: rates_by_age &lt;- smoker_numbers_age %&gt;% inner_join(smoker_numbers_age_dead,by = c(&quot;smoker&quot;,&quot;age&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) %&gt;% ungroup() # The data was previously grouped, we don&#39;t want this anymore Use dplyr::select() to remove and rename columns, see ?dplyr::select. ## # A tibble: 7 x 4 ## age smoker_mort_rate nonsmoker_mort_rate relative_risk ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 18-24 0.0364 0.0161 2.25 ## 2 25-34 0.0242 0.0318 0.760 ## 3 35-44 0.128 0.0579 2.22 ## 4 45-54 0.208 0.154 1.35 ## 5 55-64 0.443 0.331 1.34 ## 6 65-74 0.806 0.783 1.03 ## 7 75+ 1 1 1 3.4 Prescriptive analysis Descriptive anlaysis is about understanding the data that we have. Exploratory anlaysis is about finding patterns in the data you have. Prescriptive analysis is about using the data you have to explicitly support making a decision or coming to a conclusion. Often the data has been collected for a reason. Scientific experiments, surveys, questionnaries given when applying for a mortage or insurance product; these aren’t just “fishing expeditions”. These data are collected in the hopes of coming to a specific conclusion. We might wish to state the efficacy of a clinical treatment, or decide which politician is going to win an election, or whether to grant somebody a loan or underwrite an insurance policy. Often a prescriptive analysis is conducted using exactly the same steps as an exploratory analysis. Here, you must be very careful. Knowing what you want the data to say can, and very often does, influence choices made by the researcher about how to analyze the data. This is often referred to as “researcher degrees of freedom”. For example, perhaps the smoking data was collected with the explicit purpose of supporting anti-smoking initiatives. This renders the above analysis prescriptive, because we know what we want to see: we want smokers to have a higher mortality rate than non-smokers in these data. In this context, let’s re-compute the above table of mortality rates: smoker_numbers %&gt;% inner_join(smoker_numbers_dead,by = &quot;smoker&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## smoker num_people num_dead mort_rate ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 582 139 0.239 ## 2 no 732 230 0.314 …hm. It appears that the data is telling us the opposite of what we thought it would. What do we do now? Well, we ignored some information, namely the subjects’ ages. So let’s use those: smoker_numbers_age %&gt;% inner_join(smoker_numbers_age_dead,by = c(&quot;smoker&quot;,&quot;age&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(mort_rate = num_dead/num_people) ## # A tibble: 14 x 5 ## # Groups: smoker [2] ## smoker age num_people num_dead mort_rate ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 yes 18-24 55 2 0.0364 ## 2 yes 25-34 124 3 0.0242 ## 3 yes 35-44 109 14 0.128 ## 4 yes 45-54 130 27 0.208 ## 5 yes 55-64 115 51 0.443 ## 6 yes 65-74 36 29 0.806 ## 7 yes 75+ 13 13 1 ## 8 no 18-24 62 1 0.0161 ## 9 no 25-34 157 5 0.0318 ## 10 no 35-44 121 7 0.0579 ## 11 no 45-54 78 12 0.154 ## 12 no 55-64 121 40 0.331 ## 13 no 65-74 129 101 0.783 ## 14 no 75+ 64 64 1 Oh! It’s because older people are more likely to die, and less likely to smoke. We performed the exact same steps in our prescriptive analysis as we did in our exploratory analysis. Can we make the same conclusions? This is where we need to be careful. When we go into the data with a specific question in mind, we have to report everything we see that relates to this question. We ought to report that Smokers had a lower mortality rate than non-smokers, and there were more young smokers than old smokers in the data, and younger people had a lower mortality rate than older people, in our data. Context matters! If we just reported that “controlling for age, smokers have a higher mortality rate than non-smokers”, we would be communicating a potentially spurious conclusion. What’s so important about age? We could have controlled for other variables and perhaps seen different relationships. These “researcher degrees of freedom” are a big force behind what is known as the “reproducibility crisis” in modern science. 3.4.1 Exercises For each of the following analyses, state whether you think it is descriptive, exploratory or prescriptive, and say why. I work for an urban planning think tank and I want to present to our clients a proposal that advocates the development of green spaces in urban centres as a public health initiative. I use Health Canada data on obesity and Open Data Toronto data on locations of greenspaces to investigate whether areas with more green spaces have less obesity. I am interested in which streets have more heavily enforced parking laws, so I download data on all parking tickets given in Toronto last year and make a map. 3.5 Rental housing in Toronto The RentSafeTO: Apartment Building Standards program is designed to help renters in the city of Toronto make informed choices about where to live, and to enforce a minimum standard of quality upon rental units within the city. With rents skyrocketing and home ownership not a reasonable option for most, having an informed view of the rental market is imperative for Toronto residents. It also helps keep leaders accountable, specifically if we focus on social and community housing buildings. Comprehensive and fairly clean data from the program, along with specific information, is available at https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/. Data for the following were downloaded on 2019/09/16. To start your analysis, go now and download the data and open it in a spreadsheet and have a look. Familiarize yourselves with the variable descriptions and how the data were collected; the documentation. This somewhat tedious task is a first step of any data analysis, in academia, industry, government, or wherever. 3.5.1 Load the data The data are stored in a .csv file, which stands for “comma-separated-values”. Storing data in a text file with a separator, usually a comma, is very common. These are referred to as “flat files” in an industrial context, to distinguish them from data stored in databases. We may read the data into R using the read_csv function in the readr package. The readr package is part of the tidyverse package that we used before, so if you installed that package, you have it loaded. # https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/ # install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;) # Read the data in. This means call the readr::read_csv() function, point it # to where you saved the data on your computer, and then save the result to a # variable. I am naming this variable &#39;apartmentdata&#39;. # Type ?readr::read_csv if you want to read about this function. apartmentdata &lt;- readr::read_csv( file = &quot;./data/apartment-data/toronto-apartment-building-evaluations.csv&quot; ) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## .default = col_double(), ## EVALUATION_COMPLETED_ON = col_character(), ## PROPERTY_TYPE = col_character(), ## RESULTS_OF_SCORE = col_character(), ## SITE_ADDRESS = col_character(), ## WARD = col_character() ## ) ## See spec(...) for full column specifications. The message displayed is telling you that readr::read_csv() guessed at what kind of data were in each column, i.e. numbers, letters, dates, etc. You should make sure, as I have while writing, that these are what you expect. You can get a concise view of this dataset using the glimpse function in the dplyr package, which is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse: glimpse(apartmentdata) ## Observations: 3,446 ## Variables: 32 ## $ `_id` &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1… ## $ BALCONY_GUARDS &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, 5, NA, 5, 3, 4, 4, 3… ## $ CONFIRMED_STOREYS &lt;dbl&gt; 28, 4, 3, 3, 29, 3, 7, 18, 17, 32, 4… ## $ CONFIRMED_UNITS &lt;dbl&gt; 457, 15, 26, 10, 272, 12, 95, 287, 3… ## $ ELEVATORS &lt;dbl&gt; 4, NA, NA, NA, 5, NA, 5, 4, 5, 4, NA… ## $ ENTRANCE_DOORS_WINDOWS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, … ## $ ENTRANCE_LOBBY &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, … ## $ EVALUATION_COMPLETED_ON &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04/03/2019&quot;, &quot;05/24/2018&quot;, &quot;07/11/2… ## $ EXTERIOR_CLADDING &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, … ## $ EXTERIOR_GROUNDS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, … ## $ EXTERIOR_WALKWAYS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, … ## $ GARBAGE_BIN_STORAGE_AREA &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, … ## $ GARBAGE_CHUTE_ROOMS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, NA, NA, NA, 5, NA, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5,… ## $ GRAFFITI &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, … ## $ INTERIOR_LIGHTING_LEVELS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, … ## $ INTERIOR_WALL_CEILING_FLOOR &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, … ## $ INTERNAL_GUARDS_HANDRAILS &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, … ## $ NO_OF_AREAS_EVALUATED &lt;dbl&gt; 18, 14, 14, 13, 19, 16, 17, 18, 19, … ## $ OTHER_FACILITIES &lt;dbl&gt; 4, NA, NA, NA, 5, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA… ## $ PARKING_AREA &lt;dbl&gt; 2, NA, NA, NA, 4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 4, 2, … ## $ PROPERTY_TYPE &lt;chr&gt; &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;SO… ## $ RESULTS_OF_SCORE &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Evaluation needs to be conducted in… ## $ RSN &lt;dbl&gt; 4365723, 4364249, 4408585, 4288126, … ## $ SCORE &lt;dbl&gt; 71, 77, 71, 78, 98, 76, 93, 72, 74, … ## $ SECURITY &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, … ## $ SITE_ADDRESS &lt;chr&gt; &quot;2350 DUNDAS ST W&quot;, &quot;9 STAG HILL D… ## $ STAIRWELLS &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, … ## $ STORAGE_AREAS_LOCKERS &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 4, NA, NA, 3, 4,… ## $ WARD &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;04&quot;, &quot;07&quot;, &quot;03&quot;, … ## $ WATER_PEN_EXT_BLDG_ELEMENTS &lt;dbl&gt; 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, … ## $ YEAR_BUILT &lt;dbl&gt; 1976, 1953, 1948, 1920, 2017, 1967, … ## $ YEAR_REGISTERED &lt;dbl&gt; 2018, 2018, 2018, 2017, 2018, 2017, … That’s bigger than the smoking data! 3,446 rental apartment buildings, each with 32 factors measured. The buliding’s address and Ward number are in there, which are helpful for characterizing neighbourhoods. 3.5.2 Analysis I: what does the data look like? As a first step, we want to get an idea of what our data “looks like”. This typically means picking some interesting variables and summarizing their distributions somehow. Which variables to pick will depend on the context. Often it will be clear which variables are important, and sometimes not. Because you read the documentation and familiarized yourselves with the variables in the dataset, you know that there is a variable called SCORE which sums up the individual category scores for each building. In the context of determining building quality, this seems like an important variable to look at. We’ll summarize the distribution of SCORE using a five-number summary and mean, and a histogram with a kernel density estimate. First, prepare the data for analysis: # First, select only the columns you want # This isn&#39;t strictly necessary but trust me, it makes # debugging WAY easier. # I&#39;m also renaming the columns so the dataframe looks prettier. # Again, trust me. This stuff matters. apartmentclean &lt;- apartmentdata %&gt;% filter(!is.na(SCORE)) %&gt;% # Remove apartments with missing scores dplyr::select(ward = WARD, score = SCORE, property_type = PROPERTY_TYPE, year_built = YEAR_BUILT, address = SITE_ADDRESS ) glimpse(apartmentclean) # Much nicer! ## Observations: 3,437 ## Variables: 5 ## $ ward &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;04&quot;, &quot;07&quot;, &quot;03&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;0… ## $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 71, 77, 71, 78, 98, 76, 93, 72, 74, 78, 73, 76, 57… ## $ property_type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;SOCIAL HOUSING&quot;,… ## $ year_built &lt;dbl&gt; 1976, 1953, 1948, 1920, 2017, 1967, 2015, 1970, 19… ## $ address &lt;chr&gt; &quot;2350 DUNDAS ST W&quot;, &quot;9 STAG HILL DR&quot;, &quot;130 MACP… To compute the five-number summary (plus mean), use the summary() function in R. I also want to know the standard deviation of SCORE: summary(apartmentclean$score) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 37.00 68.00 72.00 72.28 77.00 99.00 sd(apartmentclean$score,na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 7.117172 The worst building in the city has a total score of 37, and the best gets 99. The median score—half the buildings in the city have a lower score, and half a higher score than this—is 72, and this roughly equals the mean of 72.28. 25% of buildings score higher than 77, and 25% score lower than 68. So most buildings seem to fall within less than one standard deviation of the mean, which indicates that these data are fairly concentrated about their mean. To provide some context, go look up your own building (if you live in a rental building) or that of a friend in the data. Where does your building fall in terms of quality within Toronto? So far we have used tabular displays to summarize our data, for both the smoking and the apartment data. To communicate more information at once, we can use a plot. The most common type of plot for visualizing an empirical estimate of a probability distribution is a histogram. A histogram bins the data into ranges and, by default, counts the number of data points in each range. We will tell the plotting function to compute the proportion of data in each range, and then normalize the results so that the plot integrates to one (and hence estimates a probability density). This won’t change the shape of the plot. We can make a histogram in R as follows: # The ggplot2 package is loaded as part of the tidyverse score_histogram &lt;- apartmentclean %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = score)) + # Tell ggplot to use score on the x axis theme_light() + # Make the plot pretty geom_histogram( # Makes a histogram aes(y = ..density..), bins = 20, colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot; ) + labs(title = &quot;Distribution of RentSafeTO Apartment Building Standards score&quot;, x = &quot;Score&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30,100,by = 5)) score_histogram It appears that most buildings are in the 65 to 85 range. (Interesting point: at time of writing I am in the process of moving from one building to another; current building has a 66, new building has an 86 :D). Another common estimate of a distribution is a kernel density estimate, which can be viewed as a more “continuous” version of a histogram that actually draws a curve on the plot that is supposed to represent the (empirical) probability density of the data. We can add this to our plot very quickly: score_histogram + geom_density() 3.5.3 Analysis II: Do different wards have different quality housing? A Ward is an administrative district within the city that has a single city counsellor. If I’m thinking about moving to, or within, Toronto, I want to know: Do different wards have different quality housing?. In order to address this question we need to decide on the following: Variable of interest. How do we quantify our research question? We need to pick a measure of quality. Picking different measures can lead to different conclusions. Filters. Do we look at all apartment buildings? Should we look only at those built after, or before, a certain date? Only those that meet a certain minimum, or maximum, standard of quality according to our definition? Are there any other kinds of decisions we might have to consider? Methods. What kind of statistical tools should we use to address our research question? We need to pick descriptive statistics to report, and decide whether we want to include other auxillary variables in the analysis. Conclusions. How do we report our results? Tables, charts, maps? Should we include subjective, editorial commentary, or let the data speak for themselves? This is already overwhelming! Let’s make an attempt at it. I propose: Our variable of interest should be SCORE, which you know (because you read the documentation…) is the “overall score of the buliding”. Higher is better. The actual formula is included in the documentation of the data. We will filter the data to only include buildings where PROPERTY_TYPE == 'PRIVATE', which will restrict our analysis to not include social housing. The quality of social housing is an important social justice issue (that you will investigate in the exercises) but it’s somewhat separate (?) from the question of where to look for rental housing. Our methods will include looking at a table of average scores for each ward. We will also look at whether older or newer buildings receive better scores. We will summarize our conclusions through a subjective assessment of the above table of average scores. With these decisions made, we may proceed with our analysis using the tidyverse as follows: # Apply filter(s). apartmentfiltered &lt;- apartmentclean %&gt;% filter(property_type == &quot;PRIVATE&quot;) # When filtering, always compare the filtered and unfiltered data to ensure # the result is as expected: glimpse(apartmentclean) ## Observations: 3,437 ## Variables: 5 ## $ ward &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;04&quot;, &quot;07&quot;, &quot;03&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;0… ## $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 71, 77, 71, 78, 98, 76, 93, 72, 74, 78, 73, 76, 57… ## $ property_type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;SOCIAL HOUSING&quot;,… ## $ year_built &lt;dbl&gt; 1976, 1953, 1948, 1920, 2017, 1967, 2015, 1970, 19… ## $ address &lt;chr&gt; &quot;2350 DUNDAS ST W&quot;, &quot;9 STAG HILL DR&quot;, &quot;130 MACP… glimpse(apartmentfiltered) ## Observations: 2,873 ## Variables: 5 ## $ ward &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;07&quot;, &quot;03&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;17&quot;, &quot;08&quot;, &quot;1… ## $ score &lt;dbl&gt; 71, 77, 71, 98, 76, 93, 72, 74, 78, 73, 76, 57, 70… ## $ property_type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVATE&quot;, &quot;PRIVA… ## $ year_built &lt;dbl&gt; 1976, 1953, 1948, 2017, 1967, 2015, 1970, 1976, 19… ## $ address &lt;chr&gt; &quot;2350 DUNDAS ST W&quot;, &quot;9 STAG HILL DR&quot;, &quot;130 MACP… nrow(apartmentclean) - nrow(apartmentfiltered) # Dropped 567 rows. ## [1] 564 # Now create the table of averages: apartmentfiltered %&gt;% group_by(ward) %&gt;% summarize(avg_score = mean(score)) ## # A tibble: 26 x 2 ## ward avg_score ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01 71.5 ## 2 02 73.0 ## 3 03 70.5 ## 4 04 68.2 ## 5 05 71.7 ## 6 06 72.1 ## 7 07 69.8 ## 8 08 73.5 ## 9 09 67.5 ## 10 10 72.2 ## # … with 16 more rows Bah! What happened? Why are there these NA values? NA is the value R uses to mean “missing”. We have to hope that whether a rental apartment building’s score is missing is not related to what that score is, that is, we hope apartments with higher or lower scores aren’t missing more often. We will ignore missingness for now. To do this, use the na.rm = TRUE option in mean: apartmentsummary &lt;- apartmentfiltered %&gt;% group_by(ward) %&gt;% summarize(avg_score = mean(score,na.rm = TRUE)) apartmentsummary ## # A tibble: 26 x 2 ## ward avg_score ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01 71.5 ## 2 02 73.0 ## 3 03 70.5 ## 4 04 68.2 ## 5 05 71.7 ## 6 06 72.1 ## 7 07 69.8 ## 8 08 73.5 ## 9 09 67.5 ## 10 10 72.2 ## # … with 16 more rows This isn’t a super friendly way of comparing these 26 numbers. We need some kind od visualization, or plot, so we can take one look and get an idea of what is going on. In order to pick what kind of plot to make, we have to understand what types of variables we are attempting to compare. Broadly speaking, variables can either be continuous or categorical. A continuous variable consists of numbers. You can always compare the order of two values of a continuous variable (say whether one is bigger than the other), because its values are just numbers. A categorical variable takes values from a finite (discrete) set. These values can be anything. Categorical variables sometimes have values which can be compared, like “big”, “medium”, “small”; but often the values are not inherently comparable. In the case of the table of average scores by ward, we will consider avg_score to be a continuous variable and ward to be a categorical variable. Wards are labelled with numbers, yes, but they are not inherently comparable; they are areas within the city. It wouldn’t make sense to say that ward 2 were “less” than ward 17. We could have labelled them “A”, “B”, “C”,… and the meaning would have been the same. One common visualization used to compare values of a continuous variable with values of a categorical variable is a dot chart. A dot chart contains the values of the categorical variable on the x-axis and the values of the continuous variable on the y-axis. You can take one look and see whether there is any pattern in values of the continuous variable with respect to the categorical variable. We create a dot chart to visualize these summary statistics using the ggplot2 package. This is also included with the tidyverse (surprise!): apartmentsummary %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = ward,y = avg_score)) + # Set up the variable mappings theme_light() + # Make it pretty geom_point(pch = 21,colour = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;grey&quot;) + # Add the bars labs(title = &quot;Average ABS score shows moderate variability across wards in Toronto&quot;, x = &quot;Ward&quot;, y = &quot;Average ABS Score&quot;) # Informative title It looks like some wards are better than others. Or are they? Can we make any definitive conclusions based on this? 3.5.4 Analysis III: trends in quality over time Let’s go further and analyze some other interesting aspects of these data. I’m interested in knowing: Are newer buildings higher quality? We have the score and the year_built, and we’d like to investigate whether newer buildings (higher year_built) have higher scores. We have another decision to make. We could consider year_built to be a categorical variable, and make a bar chart. Or, we could consider it to be a continuous variable. Because values of year_built are inherently comparable, and because our research question involves making such comparisons, we will consider year_built to be a continuous variable. One type of plot used to compare continuous variables is a scatterplot. A scatterplot has continuous variables on the x- and y-axes, and draws a point (or bubble) at each place in the two-dimensional plane where a datapoint occurs. We can make this kind of plot in ggplot2 as well. This time, we use the raw (well, cleaned and filtered) data: apartmentfiltered %&gt;% filter(year_built &gt; 1900) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year_built,y = score)) + theme_light() + geom_point(pch = 21,colour = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;grey&quot;) + # pch=21 makes the bubbles hollow, looks nice scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1900,2020,by=10)) + # Set the x-axis range labs(title = &quot;Less rental buildings are being built recently, but they are of higher quality&quot;, x = &quot;Year Built&quot;, y = &quot;ABS Score&quot;) Very interesting. You can clearly see the baby boom of the 1950’s to 1970’s, followed by a massive slowdown in construction during the economic slump in the 1980’s, and a complete stop when rent control was introduced in 1991 (remember, these are rental buildings only). Then, we see a new wave of rental building construction, and the new buildings seem to be of higher quality. What are the highest and lowest quality rental buildings in Toronto? # Get the 10 highest scoring buildings apartmentfiltered %&gt;% arrange(desc(score)) %&gt;% # Sort the data, descending, by score slice(1:10) # Take the first ten- i.e. the top ten ## # A tibble: 10 x 5 ## ward score property_type year_built address ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 YY 99 PRIVATE 2018 561 SHERBOURNE ST ## 2 17 99 PRIVATE 2017 123 PARKWAY FOREST DR ## 3 16 99 PRIVATE 1963 70 PARKWOODS VILLAGE DR ## 4 07 98 PRIVATE 2017 2 VENA WAY ## 5 17 97 PRIVATE 1968 24 FOREST MANOR RD ## 6 12 96 PRIVATE 1960 42 GLEN ELM AVE ## 7 13 95 PRIVATE 2017 252 VICTORIA ST ## 8 02 95 PRIVATE 1969 500 SCARLETT RD ## 9 16 95 PRIVATE 1962 67 PARKWOODS VILLAGE DR ## 10 07 95 PRIVATE 2016 6 VENA WAY Wow. I know where I want to live. 3.5.5 Summary We have seen how even something simple like trying to figure out whether different areas of the city have different quality housing can require a lot of decision making. And these decisions require expertise. By taking a principled approach to learning data analysis, you are empowering yourself to live a life that is better informed. But notice that we didn’t really answer any questions in this chapter. We saw some rough patterns, but were they real? If we made different decisions, or if we sampled different data, would we have seen different patterns? In order to understand what the problem is and how to approach it, we need to take a more detailed look at the concept of error. This is the subject of Chapter 2. 3.5.6 Exercises Take each of the analyses we have performed on the Toronto rental data and say whether you think it’s descriptive, exploratory, or prescriptive, or a mix, and say why. What is that “YY” ward that shows up in the dot plot? Investigate this unusual observation. Read the documentation online and choose three variables that you find the most interesting. Reproduce the analyses I, II and III using your variables. Is there more or less variability across wards than with score? What is the ward with the highest average score? In what ward is/are the building(s) with the highest score(s)? Is this the same ward, or not? Would you expect the ward with the highest average to also have the highest-scoring buildings? Repeat this question with the lowest scoring buildings instead of the highest. If you live in a rental apartment, find it in these data. If not, find a friend’s place. How does your building compare to other buildings in your ward? Does it score higher or lower? The filter() function is your friend here, or you can use apartmentfiltered %&gt;% arrange(SITE_ADDRESS) %&gt;% print(n = Inf) and then find yours in the list manually. Combine the analyses of sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. with that of 2.3.4. Specifically, make a table and a boxplot of the average score by year. This means replace ward by year_built in the analysis of sections 2.3.2. and 2.3.3. Do your conclusions change when comparing with 2.3.4? Why or why not? Would you expect this to always be the case? Advanced: analyze the quality of social housing in Toronto. Perform a similar analysis to what we performed here for PROPERTY_TYPE == 'PRIVATE', but instead for PROPERTY_TYPE %in% c('SOCIAL HOUSING','TCHC') (equivalent to PROPERTY_TYPE != 'PRIVATE'). Does the quality of social housing in Toronto vary greatly across different wards? Is it improving or degrading over time? Do you think we have enough information here to definitively answer these questions? "],
["error.html", "Chapter 4 Error 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Statistical error under repeated sampling", " Chapter 4 Error 4.1 Introduction In this chapter we will more formally discuss the notion of error. We will learn how to identify potential sources of error in an analysis, and for certain types of error, how to quantify them. There are many different potential sources of error when analyzing data. A very limited list of examples: Human error. You may make a mistake somewhere in your code. You could join tables incorrectly, exclude/include data you didn’t mean to, compute a summary or fit a model incorrectly. Statistical error. The data you have is subject to uncertainty and variability. In a survey or scientific experiment, your data may be subject to sampling variability, which is the notion that if you repeated your data collection again under identical circumstances, you’d get different data. In cases where such hypothetical repeated sampling doesn’t make sense—for example when studying phenomena like air pollution or temperature, which occur once at each given place and time—your data is still not perfectly measured and you may be uncertain that it is fully capturing the underlying truth. Communication error. You might have perfect data and a perfect analysis, and then communicate the results incorrectly. Or, your analysis and data might not be answering the question you intended. In this chapter we will primarily focus on statistical error, because this is the type of error that, in statistical sciences, we are usually able to quantify. 4.2 Statistical error under repeated sampling 4.2.1 The idea Data is often collected as a random sample from some population of interest. If you perform a scientific experiment in a lab, you don’t measure every rat who has ever lived or ever will live; if you take a survey of Ontario residents to gauge political opinions, you don’t ask everybody. When data is collected as a random sample, it is subject to variability. Each datapoint collected is different than the one before it, and the one after it. Variability is a physical property of the universe. If I grow a plant with the intention of measuring its height, there isn’t some predetermined height that it will be, with certainty. And if I measure the height of one plant, I don’t automatically know the height of the next plant. And so on. When we compute summaries of our data—statistics—we are not saying that the value we compute from our data is exactly the truth. We hope that the summaries we compute are useful representations of the truth, which is a fancy way of saying we hope they are not too far off. But we understand that if we collected another sample, we’d get different values of these summaries. How do we know whether the summaries we compute are useful representations of the truth? We have to be sure we mitigate human error and communication error through our analysis. But they will still be subject to statistical error, because our data is a sample. The goal then becomes to mitigate—reduce as much as is reasonable, given the context—the statistical error in our summaries. In order to figure out how to do this, it is fundamental that we are able to quantify the statistical error in our summaries. 4.2.2 Example: coin flipping Let’s start with a simple example. Suppose I am interested in whether a coin in my hand is “fair” or not. Specifically, I want to know: when I flip the coin, what is the probability \\(p\\) that it comes up heads? The probability that it comes up tails is then \\(1 - p\\). The problem is: I don’t know anything about this coin. All I can do is flip it. (Note: in a few chapters, I’ll argue that in fact I do know something about this coin, and I can use this to inform my analysis. We’ll build up to that though.) How can I make an educated guess at the value of \\(p\\)? All I can do is flip the coin. Flipping the coin will give me data, and I can summarize these data in a manner which gives me insight into the underlying random process which generated the data. Since \\(p\\) represents the probability of the coin coming up heads, it seems logical that I should use the sample proportion of heads—the number of heads divided by the number of flips—for my educated guess at what \\(p\\) is. Let’s try this. First write a function to flip the coin once, then a function to flip the coin \\(n\\) times. Then write a function to compute the sample proportion of heads as a result of flipping the coin \\(n\\) times. # Function to flip the coin once, and return 1 if heads and 0 if tails. # To simulate a random variable which takes on values of 1 with probability # 1/2 and 0 with probability 1/2, I will simulate a U ~ Unif(0,1) random variable, # and then return an indicator of whether U &gt; 1/2, which happens with probability # 1/2. flip_the_coin_once &lt;- function() { # This function takes no arguments. # It uses random number generation to return 1 with probability 1/2 # and 0 with probability 1/2 as.numeric(runif(1) &gt; 1/2) } # Function to flip the coin n times and return a vector containing # the results of each flip flip_the_coin_more_than_once &lt;- function(n) { # n: number of times to flip the coin. # Returns a vector of length n containing the results of each flip. out &lt;- numeric(n) for (i in 1:n) { out[i] &lt;- flip_the_coin_once() } out } # Function to flip the coin n times and compute the # sample proportion of heads sample_proportion_of_heads &lt;- function(n) { # n: number of times to flip the coin # Returns a number representing the sample proportion of heads # in n flips mean(flip_the_coin_more_than_once(n)) } Okay, let’s try it out. I’ll flip the coin, I don’t know, 10 times, and we’ll see what kind of a value we get for \\(p\\). Note that in this example, we know that the true value of \\(p\\) is \\(p = 0.5\\). We can use this to actually assess how accurate our experiment is or isn’t. In “the wild”, when analyzing data, we don’t know this, and can’t fully assess the accuracy of our procedure. set.seed(4178032) # Pick some arbitrary number. Gives the same random numbers every time. # I do this for reproducibility, because this is a book. sample_proportion_of_heads(10) ## [1] 0.2 We conclude that \\(p = 0.2\\). What happened? Our procedure didn’t give a very sensible summary. Given that we know that \\(p = 0.5\\), knowing that, were this a real experiment, we would have concluded that there was a \\(20\\%\\) chance of heads, is not very encouraging. The key idea to remember is that if we repeated this experiment again, we would get different data and hence a different estimate. Actually, let’s just do it: set.seed(469096) sample_proportion_of_heads(10) ## [1] 0.8 That’s certainly different, though just as bad. Let’s try again: set.seed(80798) sample_proportion_of_heads(10) ## [1] 0.5 So it does work, sometimes. Can we get a better idea of what types of values this procedure returns, on average? And with high probability? Let’s try to visualize this. We’ll perform our coin-flipping experiment many times, and then plot a histogram of the resulting sample proportions: set.seed(41679) N &lt;- 10000 # Number of times to repeat the experiment sample_proportions &lt;- numeric(N) # Vector to store the results for (i in 1:N) sample_proportions[i] &lt;- sample_proportion_of_heads(10) # Perform the experiments # Plot them tibble(x = sample_proportions) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x)) + theme_light() + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..count../sum(..count..)),bins = 50,colour = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;grey&quot;) + labs(title = stringr::str_c(&quot;Sample proportions from 10 coin flips, repeated &quot;,scales::comma(N),&quot; times.&quot;), x = &quot;Proportion of heads&quot;, y = &quot;Proportion of experiments which had that proportion of heads&quot; ) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,by=.1)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + geom_vline(xintercept = .495,colour = &quot;red&quot;,linetype = &quot;dotdash&quot;) I notice a few things: Only 10 values are actually possible. In particular, if we don’t get \\(p = 0.5\\), the closest we can come is \\(p = 0.4\\) or \\(p = 0.6\\), which aren’t that close. While \\(p = 0.5\\) occurs most often, values between \\(0.3\\) and \\(0.7\\) occur very frequently. We see, in a very small number of cases, values of \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), which make no sense (we can look at a coin and see that it has no sides). While point \\(\\# 3\\) will take some more background to address, points \\(\\# 1\\) and \\(\\# 2\\) can be mitigated in a simple way: flip the coin more times. Let’s see how the number of flips affects the distribution of sample proportions: set.seed(45856) N &lt;- 10000 # Number of times to repeat the experiment n &lt;- c(10,50,100,1000) # Numbers of times to flip the coin sample_proportions &lt;- tibble( n = rep(n,N), p = numeric(length(n)) ) # Dataframe to store the results for (i in 1:nrow(sample_proportions)) { sample_proportions[i,&quot;p&quot;] &lt;- sample_proportion_of_heads( as.numeric( sample_proportions[i,&quot;n&quot;] ) ) } # Plot them plotlst &lt;- list() for (size in n) { plotlst[[as.character(size)]] &lt;- sample_proportions %&gt;% filter(n == size) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = p)) + theme_light() + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..count../sum(..count..)),bins = 50,colour = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;grey&quot;) + labs(title = stringr::str_c(scales::comma(size),&quot; flips&quot;),x = &quot; &quot;,y = &quot; &quot;) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,by=.1)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + geom_vline(xintercept = .495,colour = &quot;red&quot;,linetype = &quot;dotdash&quot;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,1)) } cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = plotlst,nrow = 2) Woah!
