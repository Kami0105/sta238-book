Data only becomes information after it is analyzed. Analyzing data is extraordinarily difficult,
but is the only way to learn meaningfully about the world.

In this book, you will learn about analyzing data. You will learn how to make principled,
measured statements about the data on hand (*descriptive statistics*); how to 
use the data on hand to make statements about the underlying world, and how to
quantify the uncertainty in your statements (*inferential statistics*), and how
to use the data on hand to make judgements, with uncertainty quantification,
about what data you will see next (*predective statistics*).
